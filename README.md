# internship-project

In this coding project, we processed different numerical inputs, specifically a five type unit converter, simple quadratic equation solver, multiplication table calculator, number system converter, etc. Outputs mainly are be the answers of the mathematical statements or as string statements, whether some input qualifies a condition or not. We have tried to make this code as user-friendly as we could.

Workflow : 
Since this project has many sub-topics, we have used a myriad of modules as listed below:

1)	Five type unit converter: 
This one has a sub-menu list for the exact type of conversion you’d like to perform. Input would be a numerical measurement and output would be a number converted into the desired unit.

2)	Simple Quadratic eq. solver: 
This code solves any type of quadratic equation. Inputs are the coefficients of the equation in proper order, entered by adding a space between each new coefficient and output are the roots.

3)	Largest element from list: 
Here we accept a list from the user and output the largest number of that list.

4)	Multiplication table:
Here we accept 2 integers, one for the number whose table is desired, and second, the integer until which the products are expected. Output is in a detailed multiplication table format.

5)	Number system converter: 
This script converts decimal into binary, octal, and hexadecimal and vice-versa. This again, has a sub-menu for the 6 possible types. The input would be in the desired number system and the output would be processed according to the user’s needs.

6)	Mathematical operations on a list: 
Here, we have a sub-menu for addition, difference and multiplication operations. Input is be a list and the output is the number achieved by carrying out the desired operation on the list’s elements.

7)	Divisibility test: 
Here we input two integers. The output is a string telling whether the other number is its divisor or otherwise.

8)	Armstrong number: 
The input here is an integer and the output, a string specifying whether or not, the input is an Armstrong’s number.
